# @emit-js/emit

A javascript event emitter for a new ecosystem of observable libraries.

## Mission

We are defining a standard API for javascript event emitting.

Using the API, **we aim to build an ecosystem of observable & composable libraries**.

Libraries export "emit composers" â€” functions that add listeners to an emitter.

## Effects

Emit is succinct and typically reduces lines of code. You'll start wanting to use emitters for more than just business logic.

The end user can dynamically add functionality (such as logging) to listeners with minimal to no code changes.

The pattern decouples libraries at the npm dependency level. The user maintains full control over library versioning and composition.

Libraries can flexibly degrade functionality if the user chooses not to include it.

## Your first observable library

Let's create the `nextLaunch` listener, which retrieves data about upcoming rocket launches:

```js
async function nextLaunch(count = 1) {
  const { launches } = await emit.http({
    url:
      "https://launchlibrary.net/1.3/launch/next/" + count,
  })
  return launches
}
```

Export an emit composer that adds a `nextLaunch` listener:

```js
module.exports = function(emit) {
  emit.any("nextLaunch", nextLaunch)
}
```

## Using observable libraries

```js
// Create emitter
const emit = require("@emit-js/emit")()

// Compose emitter
require("@emit-js/http")(emit)
require("@emit-js/log")(emit)
require("./nextLaunch")(emit)

// Emit
;(async function() {
  // Retrieve next launch
  await emit.nextLaunch()

  // Retrieve next two launches
  await emit.nextLaunch(2)
})()
```
